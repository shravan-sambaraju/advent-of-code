/**
 * Day 2
 *
 * <p>You get inside and take the elevator to its only other stop: the gift shop. "Thank you for
 * visiting the North Pole!" gleefully exclaims a nearby sign. You aren't sure who is even allowed
 * to visit the North Pole, but you know you can access the lobby through here, and from there you
 * can access the rest of the North Pole base.
 *
 * <p>As you make your way through the surprisingly extensive selection, one of the clerks
 * recognizes you and asks for your help.
 *
 * <p>As it turns out, one of the younger Elves was playing on a gift shop computer and managed to
 * add a whole bunch of invalid product IDs to their gift shop database! Surely, it would be no
 * trouble for you to identify the invalid product IDs for them, right?
 *
 * <p>They've even checked most of the product ID ranges already; they only have a few product ID
 * ranges (your puzzle input) that you'll need to check. For example:
 *
 * <p>11-22,95-115,998-1012,1188511880-1188511890,222220-222224,
 * 1698522-1698528,446443-446449,38593856-38593862,565653-565659,
 * 824824821-824824827,2121212118-2121212124 (The ID ranges are wrapped here for legibility; in your
 * input, they appear on a single long line.)
 *
 * <p>The ranges are separated by commas (,); each range gives its first ID and last ID separated by
 * a dash (-).
 *
 * <p>Since the young Elf was just doing silly patterns, you can find the invalid IDs by looking for
 * any ID which is made only of some sequence of digits repeated twice. So, 55 (5 twice), 6464 (64
 * twice), and 123123 (123 twice) would all be invalid IDs.
 *
 * <p>None of the numbers have leading zeroes; 0101 isn't an ID at all. (101 is a valid ID that you
 * would ignore.)
 *
 * <p>Your job is to find all of the invalid IDs that appear in the given ranges. In the above
 * example:
 *
 * <p>11-22 has two invalid IDs, 11 and 22. 95-115 has one invalid ID, 99. 998-1012 has one invalid
 * ID, 1010. 1188511880-1188511890 has one invalid ID, 1188511885. 222220-222224 has one invalid ID,
 * 222222. 1698522-1698528 contains no invalid IDs. 446443-446449 has one invalid ID, 446446.
 * 38593856-38593862 has one invalid ID, 38593859. The rest of the ranges contain no invalid IDs.
 * Adding up all the invalid IDs in this example produces 1227775554.
 *
 * <p>What do you get if you add up all of the invalid IDs?
 *
 * <p>--- Part Two --- The clerk quickly discovers that there are still invalid IDs in the ranges in
 * your list. Maybe the young Elf was doing other silly patterns as well?
 *
 * <p>Now, an ID is invalid if it is made only of some sequence of digits repeated at least twice.
 * So, 12341234 (1234 two times), 123123123 (123 three times), 1212121212 (12 five times), and
 * 1111111 (1 seven times) are all invalid IDs.
 *
 * <p>From the same example as before:
 *
 * <p>11-22 still has two invalid IDs, 11 and 22. 95-115 now has two invalid IDs, 99 and 111.
 * 998-1012 now has two invalid IDs, 999 and 1010. 1188511880-1188511890 still has one invalid ID,
 * 1188511885. 222220-222224 still has one invalid ID, 222222. 1698522-1698528 still contains no
 * invalid IDs. 446443-446449 still has one invalid ID, 446446. 38593856-38593862 still has one
 * invalid ID, 38593859. 565653-565659 now has one invalid ID, 565656. 824824821-824824827 now has
 * one invalid ID, 824824824. 2121212118-2121212124 now has one invalid ID, 2121212121. Adding up
 * all the invalid IDs in this example produces 4174379265.
